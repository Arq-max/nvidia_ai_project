This project was for emotion recognition

What is emotion recognition?:
Emotion recognition is the ability for an human (or AI in this case) to analyse the facial expression and deduce the emotions of another person.

Why is it important? How could it be used?:
These two questions are one in the same. The importance of the AI model comes from its application.

Healthcare:
A potential use of this is to admit patients that seem worse off than others, especially in urgent care hospitals where a patient may not have an external wound or injury. Additionally, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have experimented with AI to help children with autism read emotions better.

Business and Safety:
There are many business applications for this as well. Advertisers could use the facial expressions when consumers use their product to gauge and idea of their interest. Additionally, for cars and other transportation, the ability to detect if a driver is falling asleep at the wheel can save countless lives.

The AI:
The AI uses the 'RESNET 34' model. The system takes in a series of images and works through 'epochs' (repetitions of testing) to become more and more accurate. By doing so, the system can more accurately decipher the emotions on the face of a human.

What can it do:
So far, the AI is able to detect 3 emotions and 1 'other' state: Happy, Mad, Neutral, and 'blocked'(if there is an object obstructing the view of the user's face). These states are given by sliders on a 0.00 - 1.00 scale, with 1.00 being 100% certainty.

Additional thoughts:
If I were to improve the AI any further, I would definitely add a wider range of emotions, as well as the ability to read body language or at least detect movement. Additionally, I would add more universal images and more 'epochs'
